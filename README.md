# Patient Data Management App

## The objective of this app is to manage patients' data, being able to see and edit it.

This is a project created with Vite, React.JS, axios, and TypeScript.

When the user logs into the app, they will see the title of "Patient Data Management" and a list of 10 patient cards. Each card contains information about the patient like name, avatar, website, date of creation, and description.

As a user, you will be able to see more of the description of each card when pressing the "View more" button, or edit all of the patient's information when pressing the "Edit" button.

When the "Edit" button is selected, a modal will pop up on the screen, and the user will be able to edit or add information about that specific patient.

The app is responsive, and all components are adaptable to any screen size, focusing on mobile, tablet, and desktop. It is recommended to use it on mobile devices, as a “mobile-first” approach was used.

A paginator was created in order to make the app faster. When the user reaches the end of the patiens list, it will be displayed a button of Load more to load 10 more patient cards.
